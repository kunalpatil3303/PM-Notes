Improvement in Uber

From Riders POV:

 1. Predictive Ride Scheduling - Let users schedule a ride based on their calendar or routine (e.g., ‚ÄúSchedule ride for every weekday at 8 AM to work‚Äù). Similar to autopay

From Drivers POV:
 
 1. Sensors in car to maintain the quality of car
 2. A common gathering location near office, to avoid traffic 
 3. Dynamic Pool Matching - Use smarter matching algorithms for Uber Pool to optimize time and increase match rates during low-demand hours.
